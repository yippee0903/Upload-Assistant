### NOTE:
- This project is in development freeze. Only critical bugs will be addressed moving forward.
- More details on the future of Upload Assistant will be available at a later date.
- Thanks to all who have contributed to this project, to everyone who has used Upload Assistant and everyone who has shared this project for the benefit of others.
- A special thankyou to all of the site staffers who have shown great patience and understanding, during the development of Upload Assistant. Each and everyone one of you, who fixed issues, and quietly addressed those same issues with me. I can't emphasize enough how that has allowed me to focus entirely on fixing the issues code side, and the boost to motivation that it gave.
- To those of you who I will not name, working in tandem to bring new features to the ecosystem, you rock.
- Specifically, to everyone at Aither. You're unwavering support has been truly appreciated.
- Last but certainly not least, a huge thanks to @wastaken7, who contributed greatly to the success of Upload Assistant. Not only did wasteken7 being a whole suite of new site support, but he persistently maintained all of those sites. The sheer amount of refactoring work on the codebase, to increase the ease of development cannot be overstated.
- Upload Assistant is not dead. I look forward to sharing a new chapter in the future.

# Upload Assistant

A simple tool to take the work out of uploading.

This project is a fork of the original work of L4G https://github.com/L4GSP1KE/Upload-Assistant
Immense thanks to him for establishing this project. Without his (and supporters) time and effort, this fork would not be a thing.
Many thanks to all who have contributed.

## What It Can Do:
  - Generates and Parses MediaInfo/BDInfo.
  - Generates and Uploads screenshots. HDR tonemapping if config.
  - Uses srrdb to fix scene names used at sites.
  - Can grab descriptions from PTP/BLU/Aither/LST/OE/BHD (with config option automatically on filename match, or using arg).
  - Can strip and use existing screenshots from descriptions to skip screenshot generation and uploading.
  - Obtains TMDb/IMDb/MAL/TVDB/TVMAZE identifiers.
  - Converts absolute to season episode numbering for Anime. Non-Anime support with TVDB credentials
  - Generates custom .torrents without useless top level folders/nfos.
  - Can re-use existing torrents instead of hashing new.
  - Can automagically search qBitTorrent version 5+ clients for matching existing torrent.
  - Includes support for [qui](https://github.com/autobrr/qui)
  - Generates proper name for your upload using Mediainfo/BDInfo and TMDb/IMDb conforming to site rules.
  - Checks for existing releases already on site.
  - Adds to your client with fast resume, seeding instantly (rtorrent/qbittorrent/deluge/watch folder).
  - ALL WITH MINIMAL INPUT!
  - Currently works with .mkv/.mp4/Blu-ray/DVD/HD-DVDs.

## **Setup:**
   - **REQUIRES AT LEAST PYTHON 3.9 AND PIP3**
   - Also needs MediaInfo and ffmpeg installed on your system
      - On Windows systems, ffmpeg must be added to PATH (https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/)
      - On linux systems, get it from your favorite package manager
      - If you have issues with ffmpeg, such as `max workers` errors, see this [wiki](https://github.com/Audionut/Upload-Assistant/wiki/ffmpeg---max-workers-issues)
   - Get the source:
      - Clone the repo to your system `git clone https://github.com/Audionut/Upload-Assistant.git`
      - Fetch all of the release tags `git fetch --all --tags`
      - Check out the specifc release: see [releases](https://github.com/Audionut/Upload-Assistant/releases)
      - `git checkout tags/tagname` where `tagname` is the release name, eg `v5.0.0`
      - or download a zip of the source from the releases page and create/overwrite a local copy.
   - Install necessary python modules `pip3 install --user -U -r requirements.txt`
      - `sudo apt install pip` if needed
  - If you receive an error about externally managed environment, or otherwise wish to keep UA python separate:
      - Install virtual python environment `python3 -m venv venv`
      - Activate the virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`
      - Then install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - From the installation directory, run `python3 config-generator.py`
   - OR
   - Copy `data/example-config.py` to `data/config.py`, leaving `data/example-config.py` intact.
   - NOTE: New users who use the webui will have the config file generated automatically.
   - Edit `config.py` to use your information (more detailed information in example config options: [docs/example-config.md](docs/example-config.md))
      - tmdb_api key can be obtained from https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
      - image host api keys can be obtained from their respective sites
