**1.1.**
The names **“Upload Assistant”**, **“Audionut”**, and any confusingly similar

**1.3.**
Derivative works **may not** introduce new identifiers, branding, promotional
markings, or tool-generated labels or HTTP/S links that imply the derivative is:
- an **upload tool**,
- a replacement or continuation of **Upload Assistant**,
- or any other tool intended to performing the same function or role,
by **reusing or adapting the original branding mechanisms, output structures,
or auto-generated identifiers** provided by the Software.

The Software and derivative works **must not** misrepresent authorship,
affiliation, origin, identity, project lineage, or repository linkage.
