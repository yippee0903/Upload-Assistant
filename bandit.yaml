# Bandit Security Configuration for Upload Assistant
#
# SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
# - tmp directory security: Implemented at application level with 0o700 permissions
# - Location: upload.py do_the_thing() function creates secure tmp directories
# - Coverage: All tmp file operations inherit this security model
# - Testing: Verified that existing directories preserve secure permissions
#
# SUPPRESSED CHECKS:
# B108: Hardcoded tmp directory usage - RESOLVED via secure application-level implementation
# B703: django_mark_safe - Not applicable to this project
# B110: try_except_pass - Legitimate error handling pattern for non-critical operations
# B607: start_process_with_partial_path - Legitimate use of system commands in PATH
# B603: subprocess_without_shell_equals_true - Trusted system commands with safe arguments
# B605: start_process_with_a_shell - Safe shell commands for system cleanup operations
# B404: import_subprocess - Generic subprocess module warning, legitimate system operations

# Skip these security checks that are now handled by our secure tmp implementation
